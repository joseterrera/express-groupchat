### To run application
1. `npm install`
2. `nodemon server.js`
3. Then go to `http://localhost:3000/room-name`. You can use any room name you want — so you can go to “/random” or “/humor” or “/library” or such — each of these will be a different room with different possible users. Open a second tab on the same computer and visit the same room, and you should be able to chat with each other.
